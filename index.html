        <img src="project1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
        <p>As a passionate web developer, I am excited to introduce my latest project, Recipee – a dynamic and feature-rich recipe making web application. Developed with a cutting-edge tech stack, this project serves as a showcase of my expertise in building full-stack web applications.
            For the backend, I harnessed the power of Django, a versatile and secure web framework that seamlessly handles user authentication. The backend is deployed on Azure with a free and basic subscription, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience.
            Recipee's core strength lies in its database integration with Azure MySQL. This robust setup enables the application to efficiently store and retrieve recipe data, providing users with a smooth and seamless experience. &nbsp
            To create a modern and responsive user interface, I leveraged Angular, a powerful TypeScript-based JavaScript framework. The frontend development is well underway, and I am dedicated to crafting an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances user interaction.
            Recipee is designed to offer essential features such as user registration and login, empowering users to create accounts and access personalized functionalities. With a vast collection of recipes, 
            <a  id="readMoreBtn">Read More..</a>
            <div class="additional-content hidden">
            users can explore, search, and apply filters based on ingredients or categories to find their desired dishes effortlessly.
            Promoting a lively and engaging community, I am currently implementing features that allow users to rate and comment on recipes. This interactive element fosters a sense of belonging and encourages users to share their culinary experiences.
            Ensuring optimal performance is a top priority in the development of Recipee. I continuously optimize the backend, frontend, and database to ensure swift loading times and seamless interactions for a delightful user experience.
            As I continue working on Recipee, I am eager to share this passion project in my portfolio. Recipee exemplifies my dedication to web development, and I am excited to present it to potential employers or clients to demonstrate my skills and creativity.

    Smart Video Surveillance for Crime Detection is a groundbreaking project that I developed to address public safety concerns through advanced technology. The primary goal of this project was to create an intelligent video surveillance system capable of automatically detecting and alerting authorities to potential criminal activities.

    Utilizing cutting-edge video analysis techniques, the application continuously monitors live video streams from various sources. Through machine learning algorithms, it identifies and analyzes specific patterns associated with criminal actions, such as theft, vandalism, or violence.
    
    Upon detecting suspicious activities, the system triggers real-time alerts to law enforcement personnel, enabling them to respond swiftly and proactively. This proactive approach significantly reduces response times and enhances the chances of preventing criminal incidents.
    
    Smart Video Surveillance incorporates advanced features like motion detection, object tracking, and facial recognition to enhance the accuracy and reliability of crime detection. Additionally, the system provides detailed logs and analytics, enabling authorities to analyze trends and patterns in criminal behavior.
    
    Throughout the development of this project, I honed my skills in computer vision, machine learning, and video processing. I worked extensively with libraries and frameworks such as OpenCV and TensorFlow to implement robust and efficient algorithms.
    
    To ensure scalability and efficiency, I designed the system to be deployed on cloud infrastructure, allowing seamless integration with existing surveillance networks. This cloud-based architecture also facilitates remote monitoring and management.
    
    Smart Video Surveillance for Crime Detection is a testament to my passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. This project not only showcases my expertise in computer vision and machine learning but also underscores my commitment to creating solutions that contribute to a safer and more secure society.
